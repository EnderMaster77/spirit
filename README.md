# Spirit

Spirit is a metroidvania made with Godot Engine. The general concept is that you play as a spirit who can change what element they control, which affects how they interact with their surroundings. At the moment, the direction this game should go in is a bit muddy. There's a few paths this game might go.

## Direction

While it is very early in development, I believe I should establish goals before the bulk of design starts. Everything should follow a common theme, to which the game builds towards.

## Backstory of Spirit

Spirit was originally supposed to be an entry for Melon Jam 5. That didn't pan out, as the game was in a frankly awful (by game jam standards) state with 8 hours to comeplete the jam. With around 2 hours left, we abandoned the project because we knew we did not have enough time. A few days later, I got another idea for a game, pretty similar to the game jam game. Without the game jam theme restricting what I could and couldn't do, I set out to create Spirit.
